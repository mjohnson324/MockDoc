# MockDoc

MockDoc is a demo full-stack web application for booking appointments. Features include searching for doctors, scheduling appointments, and leaving reviews.

The idea behind the platform is that users can request free service from lousy doctors, offering a "fairer" bargain than what most US patients have to put up with.
